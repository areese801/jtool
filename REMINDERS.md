# Project Reminders

## Environment Setup

### Go Binary Path
**Status**: TODO - Handle in dotfiles refactor session

Add Go binaries to PATH in your dotfiles:
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc (or appropriate shell config)
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

**Current workaround**: Using full path `~/go/bin/wails` in this project

**When done**:
- You'll be able to run `wails` directly instead of `~/go/bin/wails`
- Same for any other Go binaries installed with `go install`
